      <p>I remember watching a YouTube video about the importance of coding, so I decided to do some reasearch and work through some tutorials on my own. I was instantly hooked! I took a couple of courses at a nearby college, then eventually made the leap to fully immerse myself in coding school. I learned how to build apps from scratch with vanilla Javascript, then moved onto building more substantial projects using AngularJS or React.</p>

      <p>When I'm not programming, you can find me filming YouTube videos or hanging out with my two beautiful dogs.</p>
